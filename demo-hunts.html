        <p>Rose Hill Game Preserve offers a variety of hunting and shooting opportunities for sportsmen with all levels of experience.</p>
        <p>Our two hundred acres has been developed as a diverse habitat for wildlife over many years. It is now entirely in a Historic Land Trust and a Conservation Reserve program which by special arrangement allows us to offer an authentic environment as close to wild upland shooting as can be found anywhere in Virginia. From open pine stands to wide mature hedge rows to expanses of native warm season grasses, hunters will find a challenging and rewarding experience.</p>
        <p>We have strong flying quail, pheasant and chukar which are pointed, flushed and retrieved by well trained dogs and handled by experienced guides. Rose Hill Game Preserve is an ideal place where parents and grandparents can introduce a junior hunter to the excitement of upland bird hunting. There is no better place to introduce them to America's rich hunting heritage and to see and learn about the natural habitat so important to continuing these traditions.</p>
        <p>Hunters may arrange to bring their personal dogs and enjoy the thrill of hunting wiht your own pet and companion. For hunters with limited endurance we can provide ATV transport to and from shooting areas. Our European Tower Shoots are an excellent opportunity for this sort of situation.</p>
        <p>A morning hunt will begin with hot coffee beverages and light refreshments then, if desired, may be followed by some warm up on clay targets. After hunt photo opportunities and game cleaning is always available. Special arrangements can be made for groups who would like an after hunt luncheon catered and served in our historic Old Kitchen or Mansion House.</p>
        <p>The Covington/Ashby family wishes to share with you the rich history of Rose Hill and their heritage of bird hunting going back almost two hundred years.</p>

            <p>Rose Hill Game Preserve offers a variety of hunting packages which can be tailored to your particular preferences. Bobwhite Quail, Tennessee Reds, Chukar and Ring Neck Pheasant may be hunted in various combination.</p>

            <img src="images/hunter-aiming-up.jpg" class="aligncenter" alt="" />
            <p>Guided hunts include trained dogs and guides and can be for either half or full day. The game birds will be placed in natural ground cover at your designated hunting area. Since safety is our utmost concern you will be given a thorough safety talk immediately before you are taken into the field. A warm up at our clay target course is available and for the less experienced hunter it is a good way to get comfortable with your shotgun before going into the field. You will then be taken to an area well away from other parties to enjoy a personal private hunt. Your guide's dogs will point, flush and retrieve each bird that you shoot. Non-guided hunts with your own personal dog are also provided at a separate rate. If you wish, we will have your game cleaned and packaged for transport home with you. We do suggest that you bring your own cooler and ice.</p>

          <div class="tab-pane fade" id="european-tower-shoot">
            <p>This package is deisnged especially for larger groups such as business entertainment events. It will be managed by a professional Hunt Master with his excellent retrievers, where strong flyi8ng pheasant are released from a 50 foot platform inside a pine grove at the center of the property. Shooters are rotated from their designated stations every 10 birds so that everyone will be positioned in different locations allowing for ample shooting by all. If you have never been to a Tower Shoot we can assure that it is very challenging even for the experienced shot gunner.</p>

            </div>
            <p>A catered lunch and photo opportunity is then provided while your birds are cleaned and packaged. You and your friends can then enjoy the historical surroundings and scenic vistas of the Blue Ridge Mountains fro which Rose Hill and Culpeper County are famous.</p>
            <p>later a second afternoon hunt can be separately arranged at which time the many missed birds scattered throughout the natural grasses and hedge rows will be hunted with pointing dogs which will be as close to wild pheasant hunting as you will find anywhere.</p>

        <h2>Safety Notice</h2>
        <p>Minors old enough to hold a VA Hunting license (min 14 years old) must present evidence that they have passed a Hunter Safety Course and minors under 16 must first shoot a round of clay targets (no charge) with the guide before being allowed to go in the field with a firearm.</p>
        <p>In addition, we suggest that hunters who have not previously shot for a few years also shoot a few clay targets with their guide before going in the field. This means you need to arrive an hour prior to your scheduled hunt.</p>
